## Abstract

The purpose of this proposal is a focus on improvement and specificity in the agent naming process.

## Motivation

Addressing the issue by removing the suffix from the GUI to uphold and maintain agent standards.
The proposed rephrasing could be, In light of the client node's utilization of a GUI across various operating systems, 
it's been observed that each agent node appends 'Agent: node=pactus-gui.exe' in its information. 
To streamline this and ensure consistency, the proposal suggests removing 'pactus-gui' and 
the additional '.exe' from the naming convention."

### Establishing a standardized suffix for the client agent.

1. As observed `pactus-gui.exe` is observed in network Agent for windows client using GUI.


## Specification

## Updating GUI for windows by removing suffix.

1. The proposal involves eliminating the suffix portion from 'pactus-gui.exe', which is currently used in the Windows GUI and linked with the network agent.
